## Firebase Fireup 

> Simple library and CLI tools to upload your files to Firebase storage.

There's two versions of this library, Python and Go
The reason is that I have a problem installing the Python version of the library to Alpine. That's why the Go version
exists, we just need to build it to a single binary and copy it in a docker file.

Therefore, I won't maintain the Python version of the library, but since the functionality is already complete, I'm not gonna remove it soon.
